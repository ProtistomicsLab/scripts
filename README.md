# scripts
This is where we store all software tools that do not require installation, compilation or doing anything else before you run them.

## **Important info for beginners:**

* **.py** files are Python scripts, i.e. they require Python to run.  

* **.pl** files are Perl scripts, i.e. they require Perl to run.  

* **.sh** files are bash scripts, i.e. they require nothing to run (since bash is everywhere by default).  


## **Currently in the repository:**

* **[branchlen.py](https://github.com/ProtistomicsLab/scripts/blob/main/branchlen.py)** (by Kacper - for extracting branch length data from Newick trees)


* **[fasta_to_phylip.py](https://github.com/ProtistomicsLab/scripts/blob/main/fasta_to_phylip.py)** (by Jadzia)
